I couldn't find a way to search for Pull Requests on all repos where I have access to the big green button. I learned that the GitHub API does (sort of) provide this information, so I thought I would make a simple app to provide a listing of all PRs I can merge.

OAuth callback powered by [gatekeeper](https://github.com/prose/gatekeeper) on Heroku.

This is also my first react app, so it's probably doing all the things wrong, but it was fun to learn.
