# All my pulls

[try it out](https://minrk.github.io/all-my-pulls/)

I couldn't find a way to search for Pull Requests on all repos where I have access to the big green button. I learned that the GitHub API does provide this information, so I made a simple app to provide a listing of all PRs.

This is also my first react app, so it's probably terrible, but it was fun to learn.
